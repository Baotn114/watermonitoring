The links below are the dashboard website and simulating codes of two sensors:

*Note: This website is not adaptive to different resolutions.


*** The simulating sensors' code ***

https://wokwi.com/projects/333497679392801364 => this code for pH sensor.

https://wokwi.com/projects/333501155600499284 => this code for turbidity sensor.

*Note: In real life, we can use the WEMOS D1 and water sensors with the same code structure above.
